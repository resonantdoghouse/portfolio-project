# portfolio-project
Udacity portfolio project

### Usage

Updating the project.json file gives you most of the text updates and meta however if you'd like to add more projects
you have to edit the index.pug file and copy the new vars. Then simply update the project.json and recompile.

Project images should be named, project.jpg

Using pug was a bit of an experiment, I've used haml in the past.
The result is a bit convoluted but I learned a bit about pug, json, and gulp :)
